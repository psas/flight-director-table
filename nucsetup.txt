# INTRODUCTION #
The Intel NUC is currently being prepared to replace our current implementation of ground control systems.
Instead of using a member's laptop and a wireless AP, we plan on condensing the components into the NUC,
using it's WiFi card as an integrated component, reducing the amount of clutter.


## Preparing the NUC ##
	1. Install Debian (I used 8.0 Testing netinstall)
	    -Load all drivers during install
	    -Installed with SSH server, but no web server
	2. Add following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list (these WILL VARY based on your Debain version name)
	 * deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free 
	 * deb http://debian.osuosl.org/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free
	 * deb-src http://debian.osuosl.org/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free	
	3. Run these commands
	    apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
	4. To install Wi-Fi on Debian Testing (kernel 3.16)
	 1. apt-get install firmware-iwlwifi
	 2. modprobe -r iwlwifi ; modprobe iwlwifi
	 3. reboot	
		#### Prior to installing pip packages listed in the readme files, create a python virtual environment 
	5) Clone the required software from GitHub with these commands
	    git clone https://github.com/psas/telemetry.git
	    git clone https://github.com/psas/commander.git
	    git clone https://github.com/psas/launch-tower-comm.git
	6) Follow the repective README files for each
